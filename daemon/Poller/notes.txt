Going forward this is going to be the standard daemon control.

Likely this is going to require an ini or inc file in the future.
values will be for:
1) logging level
2) log location
3) API host
4) API port
5) nrpe path ( at minimum for the nrpe system, however suspect it will complain in snmp for example if missing)

The cycle (-i) will always be required on CLI as we can have many different
daemons running at the same time with different iteration cycles.

We are also going to need to further test what the daemons do if the
API goes down.  It should just keep running normally until the APIs recover.
However this is going to need to be tested.

Better validation of shutdown and startup is going to need to happen.
Right now it works but is kinda clunky.

This should be called at boot via systemd before it can be considered "ready"
